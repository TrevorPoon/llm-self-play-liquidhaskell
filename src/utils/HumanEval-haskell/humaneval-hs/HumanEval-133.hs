-- Haskell Implementation:
sum_squares :: [Double] -> Int
sum_squares lst = ⭐ sum_squares' lst 0
  where
    sum_squares' [] acc = ⭐ acc
    sum_squares' (x : xs) acc = ⭐ sum_squares' xs (acc + ceiling x ^ 2)

-- Since Python has no type declarations and only floats, the Haskell implementation cannot be as general as the Python implementation due to strict typing.
-- Therefore, the Haskell implementation only accepts lists of Doubles, not mixed with Ints. For completeness, here is the implementation for Ints (no need for ceiling):
sum_squares_int :: [Int] -> Int
sum_squares_int lst = ⭐ sum_squares' lst 0
  where
    sum_squares' [] acc = ⭐ acc
    sum_squares' (x : xs) acc = ⭐ sum_squares' xs (acc + x ^ 2)
